# DiabeticDiary

## An easy way to record daily data about diabetes

An Android app for recording data about your diabetes, then displaying that data in a helpful way.

Think of it as a software version of the paper diaries your diabetic specialist used to hand out to you.

# NOTE

This app is currently written by and for British diabetics following a DAFNE-like regime.
As such, it uses the following units and conventions:-

* Blood Glucose (BG) readings are in mmol/L (millimols per litre). A normal reading would be between 5.0 and 7.0; 
hypoglycaemia is a reading below 4.5, and a hyperglycaemic event would be above 8.0.
* Food containing Carbohydrate or other human-digestible sugars and polysaccharides is measured in Carbydrate Portions (CP). 
1CP = 10g of sugar or carbohydrate.
* The app is designed to work with a DAFNE-style dosage regime;
    - the diabetic using the app is expected to follow a basal-bolus system,
    - using injections of Quick-Acting insulin which last approximately 4 hours,
    - and a daily injection Background Insulin which lasts approximately 24 hours.
* Ketone (KT) readings are also in mmol/L.
* All times are in a 24-hour format.
* All dates follow the day/month/year pattern, but are often labelled with short month names (eg January = Jan), and in some cases the day of the week.
