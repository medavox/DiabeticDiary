TODO
====

* Add freeform 'notes', tweetsize or less
	- the max size should depend on the size of a single text, varying on how much other data (QA, CP etc) we're sending.
* For the Edit Numbers Dialog:
	- format the extant numbers so they look better (eg font)
	- add a way to delete an/all entry(ies)
	- set a max number of recipients (5?), to prevent our app from being accused of spamming by the android watchdogs
* Create a Log Review screen, which displays the ~5 most recent entries



Done
===

* Make the entry-time editable
* Store entries locally
	- probably in a file
* Automatically tick a field when data is entered, and automatically untick it when it becomes blank
* Use a dialog to specify a list of phone numbers to share the entries with via SMS
	- validate entered numbers are real phone numbers

Long-Term
---------

* Sync data across instances
* Allow users to choose output format for data, eg CSV, JSON
